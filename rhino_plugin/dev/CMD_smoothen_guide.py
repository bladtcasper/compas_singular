"""Smooth a dense quad mesh with chains of vertices attached to guide curves.

Two ways to constrain, asked for first:

* **Auto** -- give the two limits once and every curve on the Guides layer gets its chain
  selected on those limits. Nothing is picked and nothing is edited by hand: the guides
  that shaped the layout are the guides the mesh is held to. Every one is selected BEFORE
  anything is attached, because attaching moves vertices and a guide processed second
  would otherwise be choosing on a mesh the first had already pulled about. Guides that
  get nothing are named, with the reason.
* **Hand** -- one guide at a time: the same automatic proposal, then Add / Remove / Clear
  before it is attached. Use it for the guides Auto refused, or where the proposal is
  right about the course but wrong about how much of it you want.

**The proposal is a piece of a POLYEDGE.** ``QuadMesh.collect_polyedges`` already has the
long lines of the mesh -- each one running from boundary to boundary or singularity to
singularity across four-valent vertices -- so the chain is not built up vertex by vertex,
it is CHOSEN: the longest run of one polyedge that still follows the guide. Building it up
was tried three ways and all three failed. A radius round the curve collects a ragged band
from both sides and folds faces when it is projected (max angle 180.00 on square+ring
cable); the nearest vertex per station comes out a zigzag; and a walk that turns where it
cannot go straight turns onto a DIFFERENT polyedge. Choosing a run of one polyedge cannot
do any of those, by construction.

Two gates decide how much of the polyedge is taken. DISTANCE asks whether a vertex is near
the guide; ANGLE asks whether its line is still going the guide's way, which is what cuts
the chain where the polyedge veers off near the ends.

**A boundary vertex is never moved onto the guide -- at most it SLIDES along the outline.**
Moving it takes the outline of the building with it, since attaching a vertex overrides
the boundary constraint it would otherwise have had.

The whole algorithm lives in ``compas_singular.editing.guide_chain`` and is measured,
without Rhino, in ``examples/dev_examples_tests/guide_chain_tests``. This file is the picks, the prompts and
the bake.
