**RUN IT ONCE TO ATTACH, AGAIN TO DETACH.** While it is attached you keep using
Rhino normally: model, run any other CMD_ command, undo your own work, change
layers and views. The link only acts when Rhino is idle, and it never acts while
you are inside a command.

**This is a COURIER, not an implementation.** It understands six verbs --
``ping``, ``pull``, ``push``, ``pull_coarse``, ``push_coarse``,
``push_markers`` -- and nothing about meshes. Every decision about a
mesh is made by ``compas_singular.mcp`` in a separate process, which is tested
without Rhino in ``tests/test_mcp_*.py`` and ``examples/rhino_plugin_tests/test_mcp_link_rhino_side.py``. Nothing here decides anything.

**Why a spool of files and not a socket.** A Rhino document may only be touched
from the main thread, so a background listener would have to hand its work
across anyway. A directory of JSON files does that with no thread and no port to
leak, and a request posted while Rhino is closed simply waits instead of failing.

**FOUR THINGS KEEP THIS OUT OF YOUR WAY**, and they are the whole design:

1. It never runs inside a command. ``RhinoApp.Idle`` fires while you are in the
   middle of a pick too, so the first thing the handler does is check
   ``Command.InCommand()`` and give up the tick if you are busy. Requests queue
   and drain when you finish -- which is also why the link never fights
   ``CMD_densities`` or any other command for the document.
2. A write is one named undo record. Your Ctrl+Z steps over your own modelling;
   the link's bake is a single step called "MCP push" that you can undo on
   purpose.
3. It never changes your selection, your current layer, or your view.
4. It writes only under ``TopologyProblem``. Never to a layer you made.

**A purge is expected, not an error.** ``CMD_dev_reload`` empties every
``compas_singular`` module out of ``sys.modules``, which leaves this one holding an
orphaned copy. The handler notices and rebinds. That is safe here only because the wire format is plain
JSON with no compas types in it -- nothing is pickled and nothing is
``isinstance``-checked across the boundary, so two copies of the package alive at
once cannot produce the ``not the same object as ...Mesh`` failure.
