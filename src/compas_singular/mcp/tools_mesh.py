#: measured anywhere.
VISUAL_CHECKLIST = """Look at the image and judge these four, none of which any
number in this report covers:

1. BOUNDARIES. The input walls are drawn in orange UNDERNEATH the mesh. Where
   the mesh sits on its boundary the orange is hidden. Anywhere orange shows
   along an edge, the mesh has left the wall it was supposed to follow -- say
   where.
2. POINT FEATURES. Each input point feature is a magenta RING. A respected one
   has a magenta DISC (a pole) inside it. A ring with no disc in it is an input
   the mesh ignored.
3. GUIDES. Input guide curves are green, also drawn underneath. Say whether the
   mesh runs along them or crosses them.
4. SMOOTHNESS AND POLYEDGE CONTINUITY. Follow the grey grid lines across the
   mesh. They should run as continuous, gently curving families. Report kinks,
   abrupt direction changes, strips that pinch or fan, and any lumpiness or
   waviness in a region that should be regular. Around a red disc (an irregular
   vertex) some distortion is unavoidable and is NOT a defect -- what matters is
   whether it stays local or propagates away across the mesh.

Report what you actually see, including "nothing wrong" if that is the case. Do
not restate the numbers; they are above."""
