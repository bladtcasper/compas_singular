#: Fewest points a CLOSED curved input is divided into, whatever ``max_edge``
#: says. A curve is divided by CHORD LENGTH here, so the count a loop gets is
#: its own length over the background spacing -- and a small feature is short.
#: At the default spacing of 0.5 a round hole of radius 0.64 or less came out as
#: a regular OCTAGON: 45 degrees of turn per vertex, which is exactly the angle
#: a cross field cannot tell from a corner (see ``13_limits.py``). Rhino's own
#: Convert samples by DEVIATION instead and never does this, which is why the
#: same boundary worked once it had been converted by hand first.
#:
#: 28 caps the turn at 12.9 degrees, comfortably clear of that limit, and is
#: measured: it puts every curved domain in the test set on the field route,
#: while 32 and above start costing background triangle quality -- the loop's
#: chords fall well below ``target_length`` and ``background._densify_loop``
#: only ever subdivides, so it cannot coarsen them back. Measured minimum
#: background angle on a rounded plate with a radius 0.5 hole: 20.8 deg at the
#: old floor of 8, 11.0 at 28, 9.3 at 32, 6.3 at 48.
MIN_CLOSED_CURVE_POINTS = 28

#: A CLOSED loop's point count is rounded UP to a multiple of this.
#:
#: ``framefield.symmetry.Symmetry.detect`` matches by POINT SET at a 1e-6
#: tolerance, so a symmetric drawing is only detected as symmetric if its
#: SAMPLES are symmetric too. Dividing a circle into ``n`` equal parts gives a
#: set closed under a quarter turn only when ``n % 4 == 0``; ``n`` even gives
#: order 4 and ``n`` odd order 2. The count came straight from
#: ``length / max_edge``, so it was effectively arbitrary: measured on a square
#: plate with a centred hole at spacing 0.5, radii 0.5-2.0 detected the full D4
#: (count 28, from the floor above, which happens to be a multiple of 4) while
#: r=2.5 gave count 31 and collapsed to order 2, and r=3.0 gave count 38 and
#: order 4. Rounding up costs at most three points.
#:
#: This fixes the COUNT, not the PHASE. ``DivideByCount`` starts at the curve's
#: seam, so the same 28-point circle rotated 5 degrees still measures order 4:
#: the mirror axes no longer land on samples. Draw holes with the seam on a
#: symmetry axis (Rhino's own circles have theirs at angle 0, which is why this
#: is rarely hit), or pass an explicit group instead of ``'auto'``.
