#: How far off the guide a chain vertex may sit, in mean edge lengths -- i.e. in target
#: quad edge lengths, the number the user set when the mesh was densified.
#:
#: A vertex is YANKED exactly as far as it was allowed to sit off the guide, so this sets
#: both how much of the guide is covered and how hard the mesh is pulled about.
#:
#: There are TWO gates and they catch different failures, which is why both are kept.
#: Swept over 14 guides on three meshes (``examples/dev_examples_tests/guide_chain_tests``) -- worst face
#: angle after attaching, and mean coverage:
#:
#: ========= =================== =================== =========================
#: tolerance angle off (90 deg)  angle on (30 deg)   refused
#: ========= =================== =================== =========================
#: 0.6       31.6 deg / 70%      31.6 deg / 76%      diagonal, wall
#: 0.8       15.9 deg / 74%      31.6 deg / 79%      diagonal, wall
#: 1.0       0.0 deg / 78%       0.0 deg / 82%       diagonal
#: 1.5       0.0 deg / 80%       0.0 deg / 83%       diagonal
#: **2.0**   0.0 deg / 87%       **0.0 deg / 89%**   diagonal
#: ========= =================== =================== =========================
#:
#: **The angle gate is what makes a wide distance safe**, and it is why the default can be
#: this generous. Without it, widening lets a chain follow a guide past the point where it
#: has stopped being parallel and the worst face falls to 15.9 at 0.8 alone; with it, those
#: vertices are dropped instead. Going from 0.8 to 2.0 with the gate on changes only three
#: of the fourteen guides, and two of those are gains:
#:
#: * ``square/axis`` -- 78% coverage to 100%, worst face angle unchanged at 49 deg;
#: * ``square+hole/ring`` -- a circular guide over a square-cornered ring goes from a
#:   3-vertex stub at 13% to the whole 17-vertex ring at 100%, worst face 78 to 41 deg,
#:   because its corners sit 1.67 edge lengths out and nothing tighter can reach them;
#: * ``square/wall`` -- a guide drawn ON the outline is no longer refused, and the row one
#:   in gets pulled onto the wall (0.0 deg). This is the price, and no angle can catch it:
#:   the row one in from a wall is perfectly parallel to it. Drop to 0.8 to have the
#:   distance gate refuse that case for you.
#:
#: ``diagonal`` is refused at every setting and should be: it runs at 45 degrees to both
#: families, so no polyedge follows it.
DEFAULT_TOLERANCE_FACTOR = 2.0

#: How far a polyedge may run off the guide's tangent AT a vertex, in degrees, and still
#: have that vertex selected.
#:
#: Applied PER VERTEX, which is the whole point of it: distance asks whether a vertex is
#: near the guide, angle asks whether its line is still going the same way. A polyedge
#: that runs beside a guide and then veers off keeps passing the distance test for a
#: vertex or two after it has stopped following, and those are exactly the vertices whose
#: projection bends the mesh. Cutting them is what the gate is for.
#:
#: Swept at tolerance 1.5 so the distance gate cannot mask it: 45 and 90 select
#: everything; 30 refuses the 45-degree ``diagonal`` guide, which no polyedge follows; 20
#: additionally refuses a circular guide over a square-cornered ring. 30 is the value that
#: refuses what should be refused and nothing else. 90 turns the gate off.

    boundary : {'anchor', 'exclude', 'free'}, optional
        What the chain may do with boundary vertices.

        * ``'anchor'`` -- a polyedge that is entirely on the boundary is refused, so the
          only boundary vertices that can survive are the two ENDS of an interior
          polyedge. A cable drawn wall to wall reaches the wall.
        * ``'exclude'`` -- boundary vertices are dropped as well, so the chain stops one
          vertex short at each end.
        * ``'free'`` -- no restriction: the outline itself may be selected. This exists so
          a measurement can show what that costs; it is not a setting to use.

    Parameters
    ----------
    mesh : compas_singular.datastructures.QuadMesh
        The mesh the chain was selected on, unmodified.
    chain : list[int]
        The chain, as returned by ``guide_chain``.
    guide : GuideCurve | sequence[point]
        The guide it was selected for.

    Returns
    -------
    dict
        ``n``
            The number of vertices.
        ``boundary_interior``
            Boundary vertices that are NOT at an end of the chain. Must be 0: a chain
            running along the outline takes the outline with it when it is projected.
        ``boundary_ends``
            Boundary vertices at an end, 0 to 2. These are anchors, and are allowed.
        ``valid_path``
            Whether every consecutive pair is a real edge and no vertex repeats.
        ``purity``
            The share of interior triples that continue straight across the middle
            vertex. 1.0 means the chain IS a piece of a polyedge.
        ``runs``, ``longest_run``
            The number of maximal straight runs and the longest, in vertices.
        ``turn_max``, ``turn_mean``
            The geometric turn off straight at each interior vertex, in degrees. A
            polyedge is topologically straight but not geometrically straight, so these
            are read against the mesh, not against zero.
        ``alignment``
            How closely the chain's edges run along the guide, 0 to 1.
        ``off_max``, ``off_mean``
            Distance from the guide, in mean edge lengths.
        ``coverage``, ``gap_start``, ``gap_end``
            The share of the guide the chain spans, and what is left at each end.
        ``min_face_angle``, ``folded_faces``
            The worst face corner angle among the faces around the chain, and the number
            of faces that turn inside out, after the chain is projected onto the guide on
            a COPY of the mesh. A band selection folds faces; a course must not.
        ``end_drift``
            How far an anchored boundary end moves off the outline when it is projected,
            in mean edge lengths. This is the price of allowing anchors.
